    <p>Hey-ya!</p>
    <p>We’ve stumbled upon a new way of building social media products that are actually healthy for people.</p>
    <p class="mb-10">The premise is simple: prioritize the depth of local over the scale of global, and support people within communities to deepen their relationships with one another.</p>
   
   <h4>How do you build?</h4>
    <p>We get together a small team, pick a build-practice (or make up a new one), and play.</p>
    <p class="mb-10">Honestly, showing up is the hardest part. Oh, and regularly admitting that whatever expertise or skillset you arrived with, it’s secondary to the group play. What got you here won’t get you there kinda thing.</p>

    <h4>What is this place?</h4>
    <p>It feels like we’ve created a build-lab meets Montessori school for adults. Everything we do is self-directed, based on interest, and done out of the joy of doing.</p>
    <p>Through experimentation we’ve uncovered a library of social rituals for building social tools. Our practices are modular, and easily adaptable. Rituals simply designed for groups of builders to collaborate, experiment, and ship.</p>
    <p class="mb-10">The bonkers part is: it’s super fun. We’re making interesting tools in the process, and as builders, we’re growing. This way of building develops our understanding of ourselves as part of a community. From this vantage we emerge community products people love.</p>

    <h4>How can I help?</h4>
    <p>We want to protect our freedom to explore while continuing to output communal products. It’s possible we’ve cooked up a way to do so.</p>
    <p>It looks like forming a non-profit, creating fellowship and residency positions, and playing together in seasons. In the process, we’re training the next generation of social builders and outputting community goods.</p>
    <p>Here’s where you come in.<br>
      We’ve been kinda monkish over the last few years, going deep on this pattern and practicing what we’re now preaching. We want to find the others, folks who can see what we can see, and who want to be part of what we’re creating.</p>
    <p class="mb-10">This is an invitation to pass us around, introduce us to your friends, get in touch. If you don’t reach out, we just might.</p>

    <p class="mb-10">We’re Relational,<br>and we can’t wait to meet you.</p>
