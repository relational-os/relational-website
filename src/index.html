  <h1 class="pt-5  text-gray-200 leading-tight max-w-2xl text-center">Come build public good communications with us</h1>
  <p class="mb-10 italic text-gray-500">Relational is a fun lab full of clever people experimenting with communications tech.</p>

  <p class="mb-12">The internet has fundamentally changed the nature of how we communicate, and as a result how we commune, convene, cooperate and collaborate. The root of human culture, our digitally mediated socialization is a shared human interest across market, state, religion, and everywhere in between.</p>
  <p class="mb-12">Relational is located at this crossroads, a place designed for social builders from myriad backgrounds: technologists, communications artists, and social workers. Here we agree to find common ground to allow for a productive mixing of shared interest in developing public good digital communications products.</p>
  <p class="mb-12">Our core offering is a fresh approach to teaching and learning how to build digital comms public goods. Designed as a kind of Montessori school for social builders, Relational is a peer-to-peer practice-based milieu.</p>
  <p class="mb-12">Our ethos is rooted in the self-organizing concepts of agency and interdependence, with an emphasis on building-to-understand. Working with edge technologies like blockchain and augmented-intelligence, weâ€™ve carved out a niche in the world for social builders to explore and play.</p>
