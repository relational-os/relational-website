    <h1>Relational is a <b>way of work</b> </h1>
      <h1>and a <b>community of practice</b> </h1>
        <h1>for <b>social technologists </b></h1>
  <div class="max-w-lg">
    <p><b>Who we are</b></p>
    <p>From the engine room tinkering with database design out into the world to playtest our creations, we are a diverse group of high-agency individuals working across the tech continuum</p>
   
    <p><b>What we do</b></p>
    <p>Creating software products that are as playful as they are useful, we find elegant and creative solutions to complex social problems.</p>

    <p><b>How we operate</b></p>
    <p>Through playful, participatory and build-centric practices and rituals, we make cross-functional collaboration fun. <br><br> 
      Our social practices are open-source, peer-to-peer, modular, and designed for a diversity of builders to experiment, create, and ship.</p>

    <p><b>Why we do it</b></p>
    <p>By actively exploring the ethical, spiritual, and philosophical conundrums of social tech, we are in better relationship with ourselves, each other and the world.</p>
