  <p class="max-w-lg mb-16">Relational is a refuge for social technologists: people who care deeply about how humanity interfaces with the digital world. This is a space for us to convene, discuss and work together in building social-first products.
    <br><br>
   Digital technology is ushering in an unprecedented change in how the world operates. It seems like every day there’s a new technical innovation that provides us with a new perspective on how to be human.

    <br><br>
    
    To keep pace with the changes that keep-on-coming, we play. By exploring what’s possible, we find new, delightful ways to be human together.
    <br><br>
    We’re a volunteer-run, unofficial organization, working on the fringes of the digital tech frontier. Our core team has been playing together for 4+ years, and we’re figuring things out as we go.

    <p class="max-w-lg mb-16">Relational started in 2019, Kristen and Dave followed their shared entrepreneurial spirit, and set out on a mission to build digital tools that helped people better connect. Their vision was a social milieu rooted in relationship, in meaning, and finding value here first. So began Relational in earnest.</p>
