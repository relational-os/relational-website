  <p class="max-w-lg mb-16">Relational is a fresh take on a digital product studio. With a focus on learning and experimentation, we prioritize play above all else.<br><br>

    Our approach is in response to the change cultural landscape at the intersection of technology, governance, market, and religion. Digital technology is ushering in an unprecedented change in how the world operates. It seems like every day there’s a new technical innovation that provides us with a new perspective on how to be human.<br><br>
    
    To keep pace with the changes the keep-on-coming, we play. By exploring what’s possible, we find new, delightful ways to be human, together.<br><br>
    Currently, we’re running a lean team of stewards and builders. Our stewards have the broad view of Relational and are shaping the organizational structure. Our builders are masters of craft who architect the practices and approaches to playfully building as a community.<br><br>
    We’re forming a Wisdom Council of societal leaders, elders, to guide our work. We may be crazy enough to tackle the problem of digital human connection, but we’re not so foolish as to think we can go it alone.

    <p class="max-w-lg mb-16">Relational started in 2015, as Kristen scrolled through the OKCupid dating app and slowed when she saw Dave. As a visual artist and product designer building consumer software, at-a-glance Dave couldn't have been more different from Kristen: a clinically trained social worker and qualitative researcher consulting with governmental health care entities.<br><br>
  
      As they got to know each other, Dave and Kristen would slowly discover both of their life's work centered on navigating social patterns, social organization, and moving people through systems. Kristen simply did it without building software; Dave built tools to ease the process.<br><br>
      
      By 2019, Kristen and Dave followed their shared entrepreneurial spirit, and set out on a mission to build digital tools that helped people better connect. Their vision was a social milieu rooted in relationship, in meaning, and finding value here first. So began Relational in earnest.</p>
