  <p class="max-w-lg mb-16">Relational started in 2015, as Kristen scrolled through the OKCupid dating app and slowed when she saw Dave. As a visual artist and product designer building consumer software, at-a-glance Dave couldn't have been more different from Kristen: a clinically trained social worker and qualitative researcher consulting with governmental health care entities.<br><br>

    As they got to know each other, Dave and Kristen would slowly discover both of their life's work centered on navigating social patterns, social organization, and moving people through systems. Kristen simply did it without building software; Dave built tools to ease the process.<br><br>
    
    By 2019, Kristen and Dave followed their shared entrepreneurial spirit, and set out on a mission to build digital tools that helped people better connect. Their vision was a social milieu rooted in relationship, in meaning, and finding value here first. So began Relational in earnest.</p>
